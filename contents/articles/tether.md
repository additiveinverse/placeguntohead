at my junior high  
on the playground  
which barely qualified as a playground  
more like a prison yard without the sentries  
we had tetherball poles  
only no tetherballs.  

just the poles and the strings.

during one of my periods of homelessness  
years later

i would try to sleep in this playground  
but usually wound up sittinng there  
in the dark  
looking at the shadows  
the poles  
now without strings  
cast in the moonlit dirt.

one night  
after trying in vain to sleep  
i decided the poles without purpose have had enough purposelessness  
we've all had enough  

these kids needed poles with strings  
with balls on the end  
that they could punch and send hurdling through space towards whomever was on the other side.  
we needed meaning  
these poles and i  
purpose fufilled  
Destiny!

I grabbed my sketchbook  
scribbled a note  
tore out the page  
slapped the note to one of the poles with some gum

> "BRING US THE BALLS ON STRINGS OR WE WILL PUT YOUR HEADS ON THESE POLES.
>  ~ thank you, the children."

I never went back.  
I found much nicer places to sleep.
