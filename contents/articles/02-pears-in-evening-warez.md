Pearz  
  In pretty dresses  
  With Nowhere to go  
    
  This is a subtle nod  
  To a thing that is how i am fairly certain  
  Most electronic musicians got started with  
    
  Warez  
  And the hax0rz that cracked   
  Patched  
  Hacked  
  And stole software.  
    
  I hesitate to admit that most of the first audio softwares i used  
  Were pirated  
    
  I grew up  
  Eventually  
  I realized that the tools you use and love  
  That line up with your brains wiring  
  Are worth whatever the developers are asking for them.  
    
  And if you are going to expect people to pay for the things you make with these tools  
  You should in turn pay for them
