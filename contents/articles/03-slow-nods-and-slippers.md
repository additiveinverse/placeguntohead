Reading burroughs  
- - Having never done heroin ( Thankfully )

Often dreaming of being "on the nod"  
- Able to only hit the space bar  
and dive in  
Pausing indefinitely  
- - the opposite of "on the clock"  
- Wrapped in a bathrobe  
- - Carrying a giant stuffed shark  
- Unconscious conscious   
- Dreaming awake  
- Slow time still  
- - - Gravity immense  

Not nearly as glamourous as it sounds.
