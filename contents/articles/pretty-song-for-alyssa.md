Shortly after moving in with my girlfriend
now wife 
alyssa.
I would vanish to the office/studio/corner to work on music. 
We would routinely have a house full of people 
and I after an hour 
I would start slowly walking out of the room backwards hoping no one would notice.
one backwards step at a time

Inevitably
The she would find me
Head phones on 
chipping away at whatever was rattling around between my ears

after a few moments of silently standing in the doorway
leaning 
arms folded 
against the door frame
listening to whatever ruckus I happen to be making...
staring at the back of my head
( more often that not )

She would say
"so,.. when are you gonna make ME a pretty song"

The last time she asked
with a few filtered steve reich samples 
I happened to be playing around with
I said 
"right now."
