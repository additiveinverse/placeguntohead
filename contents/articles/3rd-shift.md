I cant sleep.  

- at night.  
- - like a normal person  
- i have never been able to  

because of this  
i've lost many Mcjobs  
every so often id take a graveyard job in attempt to counter this  
let me just say,...  
i LOVE graveyard shifts  
which if you've ever worked a graveyard shift anywhere  
you know what they can be like  
especially if you get to work them by yourself  

in 98 or 99  
I was working nights at a gas station from 11pm to 7am  
shielded behind two inches of plexiglass  
talking to my friends  
the ones still awake at two or three  
through a circular vent in the plexiglass wall  
and  
then they'd leave to sleep  
while I got to kept drinking coffee  

there is a calmness  
that creeps in and solidifies between the hours of 3 and 4  
its lovely  

the darkside of working a graveyard shifts  
over time  (could be months - weeks)
regardless of how social you _try_ to be  
you start feeling disconnected  
your whole life becomes sheilded behind two inches of plexiglass  
where you sit  
head against it  
drawing pictures in the fog from your breath  
bored  
drained  
it follows you home  
it clings to you  
it becomes a suit of plastic armor  

there were words to this song  
appearing one line per pattern as they played through  

> its well after  
two am  
the plexiglass  
dividing  
me from the rest  
of the world  
is fogged over  
with the stale  
lifeless residue  
that calls at  
this hour  
leaving grease  
prints behind.  
the parking lot  
empty. except  
for the wind  
blowing the  
trash back  
out onto the  
streets again
