Somehow.
I landed a contract role as a customer support rep  

- at an education startup  

It was my first taste of working at a tech company  
The people were smart, funny, and great to work for
I worked there maybe 6 months before [their bubble burst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)  
they shuttered completely  

- the same day they announced it to 50 employees
- - "We tried to keep the lights on as long as we could"

sent us all home  
wondering what went wrong
