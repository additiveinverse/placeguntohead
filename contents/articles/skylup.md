I often wish I could take snap shots of the sky  
Turn them sideways  
Translate them into -what I imagine as the hidden music of the world  
Return them as loosely coupled sonnets  
That repeat  
endlessly  
Synced to the rising tides  
To the slow decay  
Wind them up  
  [ Old watches and children's toys ]  
Send them fluttering upwards  
To streak across the sky  
Beautiful alarms  
Warning end of day  
And in shining streaks of firefly gold 
Herald the best parts of the evening  
With you.
