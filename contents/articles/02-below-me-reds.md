I used to work as a projectionist at a dollar theater  
it was one of the best shit jobs I've ever had  
I didnt have to be there until 1pm  
I could be alone for a large portion of my shift  
I was in the dark for 90% of it (barring a few cigarette breaks)  
and once I started the next round of showings  
I could sleep on the extra movie seats the other projectionists  
and I had fashioned into a couch

but the best part of this barely over minimum wage nightmare  
were thursday nights  
a full night of work  
building the new arrivals for friday

part of this elaborate construction process was that  
after closing someone had to watch them all  
carefully  
to make sure that splices were in the right spots  
and run upstairs to fix them if they broke  
we had pretty crappy equipment   
most of which was rigged together  

so quality assurance was crucial for the next days business  

we had little get togethers on thursday nights  
we had full run of the theater  
the ushers  
the closing manager (who would normally get beer for those that wanted it)  
we would all invite a few friends to watch whatever crappy movies had come in  
yes  
thursday nights were awesome  
a regular smoke filled mystery science theater  

one thursday night in particular  
a friend of mine when cornered with a particulary scathing insult  
blurted out "my shoes are BELOW ME"  
This was his usual response for when he knew he'd been bested.  

This time  
no sooner had the words left his mouth  
his nose started bleeding profusely  
as if someone had punched him squarely in the nose  
everyone who was close enough to witness this spectacle  
doubled over with laughter  
in response  
he quickly grabbed one of the collapsed cardboard popcorn boxes  
and   
in his own blood  
scrawled the words  

> "too much caffiene, nicotine, and sodium"  

then began dancing his best vaudeville softshoe   
with his newly created signage  
all the while  
his head back  
fingers pinching his nose to keep the blood from running out
