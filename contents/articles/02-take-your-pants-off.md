The most popular topic of song  
aside from failing relationship drama  
is fucking  

In order to keep it radio friendly though   
Most pop music  
sidesteps it with metaphor   
tries to bury it under terribly executed innuendo  
but  
it's there.  
We all know it.  
We have eyes and ears  

Several songs come to mind  
fitting this mold  
None of which I'll quote  
I'm sure you all have a few locked away in your heads  

I set out to make something that didnt try hide  
that redefined what I thought future funk / twisted RnB  
should sound like  
that walked right up to you and said  
     "take your pants off"  
without saying a word  
and   
you would _have_ to comply

If it worked  
it would be a 'classic'  
radio stations would play it non stop  
teenagers and adults alike would hum on subway trains  
in thier cars   
at thier desks  
the new russian federation of states would play it on procreation day  
babies would be made  
condom sales would skyrocket (hopefully)  

What I wound up with bears the concept as its only offspring  
It's smoky backroom sexy  
The club is closed  
The floor is gritty  
A different kind of hollow  
than the emptiness that is pop music.
