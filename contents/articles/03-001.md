001   
It is one hundred backwards

It is the 3-bit [gray code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) seed for the fractal melody generator [MusiNum](http://reglos.de/musinum/)

for the unitiated:  
MusiNum was a free sonification program which turned numbers into generative fractal music. It pushed out notes based on fractal concepts, self-similarity and "a new kind of symmetry".

Easily one of the friendliest tools to help climb out  
when waist deep in a creative rut  
and throw a little randomness against the wall  

I spent countless hours feeding numbers 
- half tone shifts
- octaves changes
into equally countless layers of "fractal" midi generators
- letting them run for hours 
- - waiting to catch something
- exporting huge buckets of midi data 
- - mine for a starting point 

001 never made it past the starting point.

All the layers clicked into place  
I couldn't hear the pattern any other way.  
This is why it begins Among others.
