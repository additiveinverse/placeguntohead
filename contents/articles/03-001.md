001   
It is one hundred years reversed  
  - ( and maybe a not so subtle nod to the cure )  

It is the 3-bit [gray code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) seed for the fractal melody generator MusiNum  

which made more than a few appearances on many a proem song  
Many hours did I spend feeding numbers in to the ten plus layers of midi notes  
digging for the perfect starting point  

It is what begins Amonth others.
