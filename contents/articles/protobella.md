Some mistakes
typos for instance
become more than a passing fuck up
'the happiest accidents'

Perhaps
For instance
You while hunting for recipies one day meaning to type: "portabello"
instead your fingers
    drunk with caffiene at 3am
type: "protobella"

There.
The little switch in your brain has been flipped
The contacts slide into place
Circuits flare in your cerebral cortex
A new connection has been made that could not have existed before.

*proto* meaning
First in time.
First formed.
Having the least amount of a specified element or radical

You go with the last definition.

*bella* meaning a beautiful thing most often female
like a boat,
or in this case a mushroom.

Yeah. 
That will do nicely.

You keep a inspirational scrap book 
with 
-    strange turns of phrase 
-    typos
-    quotes from books
-    bits of overheard conversation
-    anything you can use and go back to when your well of creativity runs dry

call it a creative morgue.
