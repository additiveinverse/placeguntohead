sometimes your imagination puts on its running shoes and goes for a brisk jog into word association  
often combining words or phrases that shouldnt  
and perhaps wouldnt exist outside of madness and obscurity  

how else would the teanage mutant ninja turtles have been created  
or even radioactive samurai hamsters  
or glow in the dark cats  

what your imagination doesnt tell you though  
is that in order for things to have  
well  
order  
you have to do the rest of the running  
usually ending in a full bore sprint to whatever finish line you've decided to set  

this particular sprint started with the phrase 'bolt action'  
pull the pin back  
put a round into the chamber  
and...  
ardvark  

Silly brain.
