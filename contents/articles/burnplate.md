years ago  
i considered myself a artist  
one of those analog artists  
that used paint  
knives  
canvas  
wood  
(years prior to discovering the digital arts)  

after a few unsuccessful gallery showings  
i turned to my second love 
which was music  

the primarly reason i chose this as the title track:  
burnplate no.1 the painting 
and furthermore the record 
officially marks the end of my short lived "professional" painting career  

burnplate no.1 ( the painting. which graces the cover of the record and a wall of my studio) consists of a solid sheet of plexiglass,  
covered in engine primer,  
and sliver spray paint  
which was then sprinkled lightly with gasoline  
and lit on fire while still wet  
allowed to melt for a few minutes  
extinguished  
then sewn back together where it needed it  
with some random wire  
i had laying around
