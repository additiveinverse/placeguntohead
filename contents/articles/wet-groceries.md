wet groceries is a slight homage to "dead" by they might be giants.  
to quote:
 
>"I came back as a bag of groceries
Accidently taken off the shelf
Before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their
Torches as my head fell in the basket,
And was everybody dancing on the casket?
Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want (now it's over)
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do"
 
a little grim yes?
 
now perhaps if it was raining  
and the container that held said groceries  
became soggy  
returning to pulp  
from whence it came  
tearing under the weight  
spilling its contents  
 
perfection...
