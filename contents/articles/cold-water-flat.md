for a few months i was heavily into swing and big band  
of course around the same time  
i had a thing for dressing like a clown  
complete with oversized brightly colored clothes  

i mixed my loud plaids and my stripes  
the only thing missing was the red hair  
big shoes and makeup  
you can blame [mr.bungle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bungle) for this.  

I had a girlfriend at the time  
That was way into harry connick jr.  
And while i hated it for it mundaneness  
The first few lines of  
red light blue light stuck with me  

>"I live in a tiny closet  
A lukewarm cold water flat  
With room for a couple of cinders  
A mouse, a hole, and a trap  
I don't worry about the flights  
Or count the stairs..."

if you find the right person  
it doesnt matter how destitute you are  
where you live  
it only matters how you live.
