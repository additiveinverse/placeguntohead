- These are the words my mother used  
  When she called me one afternoon  
  To relay the news of my grandfather  
  Her fathers passing  
  ( to where ive never been sure but its a thing people say)  
    
  When i was much younger i had loved my grandfather a great deal  
  As i started to grow into the person i was to be   
  He resisted  
  With  
  Grimaces at my long hair  
  Mean spirited remarks about clothing choices  
    
  'What the fuck you wanna go and do a thing like that for? You look like a damned queer. You used to be such a nice kid. Now lookatchas'  
  He was the only real racist i think i've had to know.  
    
  It was no wonder my mother stayed in the closet until he was barely lucid and senile  
    
  I did not miss him  
  And i mourned his passing.
