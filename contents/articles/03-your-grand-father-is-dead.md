These are the words my mother used  
When she called me one afternoon  
To relay the news of my grandfather  
Her fathers passing  
( to where I've never been sure but its a thing people say)  
  
When I was much younger I had loved my grandfather a great deal  
As I started to grow into the person I was to be   
He resisted  
With  
Grimaces at my long hair  
Mean spirited remarks about clothing choices  
- - an old dog barking at a world he no longer understood
  
'What the fuck you wanna go and do a thing like that for? You look like a damned queer. You used to be such a nice kid. Now look at you.'  
  
It was no wonder my mother stayed in the closet until so close to his end.
  
I did not miss him.
And I mourned his passing.
