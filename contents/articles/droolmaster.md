in houston there used to be a coffee shop  
the only one that was open 24 hours  
it was downtown  
it took 45 mintues to get there  
the place was called not su oh (that's houston backwards by the way)  
a pocket of early 90's janes addiction bohemia  
surrounded by what was quickly becoming a den of high dollar hotspots and trend infested eateries  
(ah gentrification)  

furnished with the most extreme thrift store furniture I've ever seen  
the decor was a shamble of markeshift ashtrays and art pieces  
more often than not made by patrons out of whatever junk was laying around  
everything that was thrown away or discarded was a welcome addition  

during the summer and winter of 1998 and 1999 my friends and i  
practically lived there from about 12am to 5am most nights  
 
we began to notice  
after the bars would close  
a few of the high dollar patrons would stumble in  
looking completely hammered  
and unbelieveably out of place  
the art students and street poets would silently glare disapprovingly at them  
as they made thier way to the back of the "establishment" walk up the ominous stairs in the back  
never to return  
 
for months we speculated that the owners  
were vampires  
luring people upstairs  
to an empty elevator shaft  
where they would be pushed  
to thier certain doom  
at the bottom we called "food storage"  

after several months of casual investigation  
it was discovered that we were not that far off.  
it was in fact an after hours speak easy  
where you had to know someone to get you in  
or you didnt get in  
invite only  
a dark  
room that was every bit as condemned as its patrons  
 
aside from all of this it was and perhaps still is  
the only place where the insane homeless people of houston  
were somewhat welcome  
to crash without the reprocussions of the law  
as long as they weren't too asleep or bothering anyone too much  
 
one night in particular  
my friend angry guy and i were enjoying a barely tastefull cup of coffee  
at the only booth in the place which looked like it was stolen from a 1970's pizza parlor  
when one of said discarded humans stumbled towards us  
mumbled a question to angry guy  
to which angry guy responded...  

> "sure man have a seat right there, my friends a writer to im sure he'd love to read your work"

pointing to the vacant spot right next to me.  
I glared with intent to murder my soon to be dead friend as this   
guy dressed in three coats sat down next to me.  
 
With the smelliest breath ive ever smelled  
i was told how the government didnt want us to know how JFK was killed  
or that the moon landing was filmed on a television set  
this went on for about 20 minutes  
while i sat  
smoked  
periodically mouthed "i'm going to fucking kill you" to angry guy  
until  
midsentence  
the insane mumbling stopped  
i looked over  
right as a stream of milky grey drool slid from the side of crazy homeless guys mouth  
streaming down  
i watched in horror  
as it landed on his right hand  
which  
equally as horrifying  
he awoke  
turned to me  
i looked into his deadend eyes  
as he aske me to come outside with him  
he had some of his writing he wanted to share with me  
 
yeah  
right  
that is most definately going to happen chief  
we'll just go outside  
you can show me your writing and then shank me with a sharpened tooth brush  
and jack me for the two dollars and the pack of cigarettes i've got on me  

> no  
> thanks  
i said  
> I'll meet up with you next time  
> but my friend and i should probably going soon  
and hence the droolmaster was born
