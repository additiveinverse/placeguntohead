In houston there used to be a coffee shop  
the only one that was open 24 hours  
the place was called not su oh (that's houston backwards by the way)  

the decor was a shamble of make shift ashtrays and art pieces  
and furnished with the most extreme thrift store furniture  
more often than not made by patrons out of whatever junk was laying around  
everything that was thrown away or discarded was a welcome addition  

it was a pocket of early 90's janes addiction heroin infused bohemia  
surrounded by what was quickly becoming a den of high dollar hotspots and trendsetting eateries  

The mostly unemployed of us practically lived there from about 12am to 5am most nights

We began to notice  
after the bars would close  
a few very well dressed out patrons would stumble in  
completely hammered  
unbelieveably out of place  
art students, street poets and junkies glaring at them  
as they made thier way to the back of the "establishment" then walking up stairs in the back  
never to return
 
We speculated the owners were vampires  
luring people upstairs  
to an empty elevator shaft  
where they would be pushed  
to thier certain doom  
upon a pile of corpses five deep  
This we concluded, was "food storage"

We were not far off.  

it was an after hours speak easy  
they put your name in a giant book
or you had to know someone to get you in  
name not on the list?
no one to vouch for you?
you didnt get into the room 
that was every bit as condemned as its patrons  

it was like walking into the apocalypse
No light aside from the lights that illuminated the wall of discarded shoeboxes
If one were to turn on the lights
the people and the cockroaches would both scurry towards any darkness they could find

More to the point
it was the only place where the insane homeless people of houston were somewhat welcome  
to crash without the reprocussions of the law  
as long as they weren't too asleep or bothering anyone too much  
 
one night in particular  
my friend Angry guy and I were enjoying a barely palletable cup of coffee  
at the only booth in the place 
which was obviously stolen from a 70's pizza parlor  
when one of said discarded humans stumbled towards us  
mumbled a question to Angry guy  
to which Angry guy responded...  

> "Sure man. Have a seat right there...  
	My friends a writer to I'm sure he'd love to read your work"

I glared with intent to murder my soon to be dead friend as this   
guy dressed in three coats sat down in the vacant spot next to me.
 
Inbetween breaths, of a stench most foul  
I was told how the government didn't want us to know how JFK was killed  
that the moon landing was filmed on a television set  
how the CIA had the banking system and alien technology in thier pockets
this went on for 20 minutes  
while I sat  
smoking  
periodically mouthing _"i'm going to fucking kill you"_ to Angry guy

Midsentence  
the insane mumbling stops  
I look sideways wondering what could have caused the madness to go quiet  
as a milky grey thread of drool gently slids from the corner of our new friends mouth  
my eyes wide with horror
as it lands on his right hand  

he awakes 
(a result of his built-in organic alarm system no doubt)
turns to me  
i look into his dead end eyes  
he asks me to come outside with him  
he had some of his writing he wants to share this with me
 
this is most definately not going to happen
I mean sure, 
- we'll just go outside  
-- you can show me your writing and 
-- then stab me with that sharpened tooth brush in your pocket

All for the two dollars and the pack of cigarettes I've got on me  

> no thanks

I said  

> I'll meet up with you next time.  
	my friend and I should probably going soon

and hence the droolmaster was born
