My girlfriend had a thing for daytime soaps
It began as pre hipster irony
then it turned on her and became something else.
She was in college
I was unemployed
We spent our afternoons 
- sipping coffee
- Playing video games, 
- watching tv, 
Her studying while I wrote music.
Wonderful. 
Aside from our brokenness and wondering if we were going to be able to eat next week... Ah to be young.

Her soap of choice began adding younger characters
During an appeal to reach younger audiences of people who were also obviously home sick from school 
Which I am told is how all daytime tv addiction begins

One of the first subjects they tried to tackle was bullying.
there was a character
the new girl
dark haired in a sea of blonde
the uber
"Use her as a fat shield"
