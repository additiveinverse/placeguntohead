My friend TH  
wanted to get married  
it was his mission  

He swore emphatically

> I am going to marry this girl.

about _every_ girl he dated.


Once in particular  
to the girl he was dating  
for maybe
* a week
	* or two

He bought a ring  
* declared his intent  
	* [ to everyone we knew ]
		* proposed
	* and
* had his offer accepted

They broke up a few weeks later.
