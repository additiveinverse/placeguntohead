Insomnia.  
We loved this place...  
Named unironically for 2 reasons:  
1. It was the only coffee shop that was directly across from central UT campus that was open 24 hours. 
2. They specialized in a drink called a depth charge. Which consisted of a pint glass filled halfway with black coffee and had a double shot of espresso dropped in.

Couple of those and you were an unstoppable, (sweaty) think machine  
and zero chance of sleep for a few hundred hours.  

Insomnia.  
The second floor  
- scattered stainless steel furniture 
- Barely seen through dense cigarette smog
You needed the spot lights  
- - overhead  
 as guides to what appeared as an open table from a distance only to find it occupied  
- the four 6x6 foot windows the only exhause for the space
back when you wanted to and could smoke indoors.  
Year round  
(not that it gets terribly cold in texas)  

Insomnia.  
was the perfect coffee shop.  
One afternoon upon walking up to the counter  
Expecting to be greeted with a eye roll and a complacent 'ugh customers' sigh   
We were met with a drawing scrawled  
Taped to the tip jar by the afternoon barista  
A giant screaming mouth  
All teeth and jagged lines  
"TIP OR EAT KNIFE BITCHES!"
