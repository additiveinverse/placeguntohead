There are things
that you are told to _NEVER_ do as a child

- dont eat glue
- don't be rude
- dont hit people
- don't scoot your bare ass across the floor like the dog

and finally
don't run with scissors

They like to call it "common sense"
but they are

rules.

as an adult
the running with scissors thing
you probably still shouldnt do
but I encourage you to test your adulthood
take those scissors
defy common sense
spit in the eye of reason
run down the hall
or a flight of stairs
make shrieking noises as you realize
there is no one to stop you
no one to reprimand you 
no ensueing punishment
for your disregard
and recklessness

I dare you.
It's liberating

However
in the event that you fall
slice open an artery and bleed to death
Or
have an untimely visit to the emergency room 
gouge out an eye
Or
wind up in jail for accidental manslaugher

Don't say no one ever warned you
and certainly
dont' blame me.
