we 
all 
collectively 
had a thing for this girl
who worked at starbucks 

for months we would arrive
promptly at 8
stay till closing 
drinking french press after french press
Chain smoking

we learned her work schedule
she would take her breaks with us
talk trash 
    about the people she worked with
     about the clientelle
    about music, film, books, pretty much everything

she was not my type
at all

she was tall
blonde
had a million times more energy than was tolerable
but 
she was a smart ass
And 
if you can pull that off
it goes a long way in my book

after about six months
it occured to us 
that we didnt even know her real name
(she would purposely swap name tags with the other employees)

we had been calling her barista longshot or the starbucks princess

her name was tara
and her boyfriend of 5 years
was 
    really
        nice.
