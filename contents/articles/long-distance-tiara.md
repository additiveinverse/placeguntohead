We collectively had a thing for this girl who worked at starbucks  
We would cut our visits short if she wasn't there  
We learned her work schedule  
We would arrive around 8 on the days she was working  
We stayed till close

She would hook us up with the giant french press  
She would take her breaks with us  
She talked trash  
- about the people she worked with
- about the clientelle
- about music, film, books, pretty much everything

She was one of us  
She was not my type ( at all )

She was tall  
She was very blonde  
classic prep school dress code  
had a million times more energy than was acceptible ( or tolerable )

She full of snark and damned funny  
both major _hot_ points

After months of stalking this girl  
getting to know her and her us  
We realized  
We didn't even know her real name  
(she would purposely swap name tags with the other employees)

We had been calling her barista longshot or the starbucks princess  

Her name was Tara  
Her boyfriend of 5 years  
was  
really  
nice.
