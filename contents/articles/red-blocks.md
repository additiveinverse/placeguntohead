my friends and i developed a method for composition  
dubbed "the bricklayer method" or the lego method  
i think both of those were actually coined by my friend H  
either way i'm sure its been properly named by some music scholar somewhere  
 
it went something like  
say you have 8 distinct patterns  
- one pattern of your core drum line  
- a bassline  
- a synth line
- a couple of one shots sounds
	- a voice sample 
	- a sound loop 
	- a one shot synth sound, etc 
color code to your liking.

you begin by placing down one loop at a time  
and then gradually swapping out the bricks (loops)  
until you have run out of pieces  

in practice  
i tend to use the red blocks as signifiers of fills or impending change 

"red blocks" only vaguely follows this method
