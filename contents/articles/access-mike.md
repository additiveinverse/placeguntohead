There was this dude.  
His name was mike.  
I met him in yahoo electronica chat  
Ages ago  
Back when that was a thing people did  
Before facebook  
Long before the network was 'social'

Mike made some pretty awesome tunes  
Some of them he finished.  
He had a flair for the dramatic  
The grumpy  
The depression  
The music snobbery.  
So he and I got along quite well  
only he lived on another continent

He and I would swap things we were working on all the time.

- At 3am and he would be online.  
- I would dial in at 9am
- He would be there.
- He lived online.
-- We talked all the time.

I think it was the only thing he had that didn't suck in his life  
It was certainly that way for me

One day he stopped showing up in chat  
Days turned to weeks  
Weeks to months  
Then I stopped showing up to.
