There was this dude.
His name was mike.
I met him in yahoo electronica chat
Ages ago
Back when that was a thing people did
Before facebook
Long before the network was 'social''

Mike made some pretty awesome tunes 
Some of them he finished.
He had a flair for the dramatic
The grumpy
The depression
The music snobbery.

He and I and Secede would swap things we were working on all the time.
We spent entire days chatting
I think it was the only thing he had that didn't suck in his life
It was certainly that way for me

At 3am and he would be online.
I would dial in at 9am
He would be there.
He lived online.
We talked all the time.

One day he stopped showing up in chat
Days turned to weeks
Weeks to months
Then I stopped showing up to.
